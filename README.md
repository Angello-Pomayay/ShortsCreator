# - _Shorts Creator_ -

I created this project out of curiosity, I saw online a lot of shorts that simply told a
joke/funny story, and I thought that the creation of these shorts could be automated.
I divided the entire creation process in more steps, and I created a script for each step.
The classic "Divide et impera" strategy I learned in University. The final code is not the best
result I could achieve, but it's a good starting point for future improvements.

## AI-Artificial-Intelligence
AI is a significant part of the project, it's used to generate the voice that tells the joke/story
and to generate the subtitles for the video. I could use other methods to applicate the subtitles
knowing that i already have the text, but I wanted to try the AI method that was faster and
required less code.

Elevenlabs TTS and Picovoice STT are the two AI services used in this project.
